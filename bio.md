I grew up in Taipei, Taiwan. In 2012, my family moved to Lexington, MA, and I attended Northfield Mount Hermon School in Mount Hermon, MA from 2014 to 2018. I am currently enjoying the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania but am looking forward to relocating to Austin, Texas this summer.  

In my spare time, I play a LOT of ultimate frisbee. I have been playing since I was 14 and absolutely love the sport. I enjoy every second on the field. Tournaments are one of the best parts of ultimate in my opinion as I get to spend time with my teammates and be in a competitive yet friendly and fun-loving environment. I was part of the CMU Money Mellons all four years.

I also love reading. Follow me on [StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/clotw)! I have been an avid reader since I first started learning how to recognize words. Fantasy, sci-fi, historical fictions are my favorite genres, but I will forever have a soft spot for young adult books (The Hunger Games and the Harry Potter series will remain my guilty pleasure).  

This past year, I also picked up skating. I am admittedly not the best at it and can barely ollie. Shuv-it's are 50-50. Definitely blaming my lack of skills on the inconsistent skating schedule. I plan to skate more in 2022, and my goal is to finally learn to kickflip by the end of the year.  

Ever since the Animal Crossing: New Horizons, I've been getting more into video games as well. Currently trying to finish my first ever Pokemon game, Brilliant Diamond, since my friend challenged me to finally finish a game for once before starting a new one (very tempted by Arceus). And, no, I have not finished Breath of the Wild. I still have one divine beast and Ganon left.
